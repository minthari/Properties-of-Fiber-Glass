Fiberglass is known as a strong, weightless material, used in many products in day to day life. The required raw
materials are very cheap, the bulk strength is high and weights are lower than many metals. Fiberglass can easily be made
into intricate shapes. Fiberglass applications include aircraft, fishing boats and ships, automobiles, tubs and hulls, hot tubs,
water and septic tanks, roofs, pipes, cladding, surfboards, and door siding. Aim of this work was to study the properties of
fiberglass with different layers depend on the epoxy resin and a catalyst reinforced with a fiberglass mat. The ratio between
the catalyst and resin was 1:10, respectively and the same amount of the mixture was used to prepare each layer. General
properties such as Young’s modulus, Thermal conductivity and Chemical reactions were analyzed with different layers of
fiber bars and disks. The properties vary depending on the number of layers and the amount of fiberglass reinforced epoxy
and catalyst. The Young’s Modulus and Thermal conductivity of the layers are increase with increasing the layers of the
fiber. When the sample layer is low, some chemical reactions occur, but for higher values, there is no chemical reaction.
